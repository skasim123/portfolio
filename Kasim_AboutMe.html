    <h4>    CAREER</h4>
    <p>    I have always found a great interest in the field of Architecture and Urban Design. This interest was sparked when my family and I embarked on a trip to the glorious Singapore. The elegance and sense of purity that the structures portrayed were truly extraordinary and enticing. I want to start this path, by entering into the Architecture and Urban Design department.</p>
   </br>
    <h4>    CAREER PLANS</h4>
    <p>    Becoming an architect is my life-long goal, because I love to be creative and abstract, and I want the world to see my art through the buildings that I will design. Architecture has evolved over the many eras, and has taken a turn into cubism, but I want to introduce more smooth and sleek profiled buildings. There is a lot of opportunity in the field of Architecture, and I aspire to become a revolutionary architect.</p>
   </br>
    <h4>    STRENGTHS</h4>
    <p>    I have always worked well on projects and assignments independently and individually, but I have always been very efficient and productive in a team and collaborative work-force. In the field of Architecture, collaboration is key to success, and since I am very well off in collaborative environments, I will be able to work in these conditions very dilligently.</p>
    </br>
    <h4>    ACHIEVEMENTS</h4>
    <p>    A few of my fellow peers started a non-profit organization which I was asked to join the Dublin, CA branch. This organization builds hand-pumps in poverty-strucken places of Pakistan and Southeast Asia. We have built over 36 hand-pumps, which cost approximately $1,600 a pump. Recently, an upcoming non-profit organization reached out to me and appointed me as their visual representation manager, which consists of making flyers, logos, videos, and taking photos.</p>
    </br>
    <h4>    PAST EXPERIENCES</h4>
    <p>    From my past experiences, I have learned my true passion in life, and that is to become someone who worked in design, whether it was architecture, or making flyers. All of these open opportunities that I have had have been opening up my mind to my new skills that I didn't realize I had till now.</p>
